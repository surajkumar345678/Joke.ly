# Joke.ly
This website is a Joke Teller Website. It is like Cortana and Siri that will actually tell you a joke.<br>
This website is created using Joke API to get a random joke.<br>
and then pass that joke to a Text-to-Speech API and it will tell us a joke.<br>
A nice little animatedd gif robot here.<br>
Have to press Tell me a Joke button. Basic functionality added in button using javaScript.<br>
So just press button and it will tell us a joke.
